    "In a decade of learning and practicing engineering, I have found that working in diverse teams enriches not just the project, but me as a person. The desire to surround myself with smart, unique people - and to contribute my own unique skills and perspective - is a primary part of my dream to work abroad in Germany. The other goal is to find an exciting, innovative application for my programming and data science skills; I think BMW's technology research division is the perfect fit for both of these."
